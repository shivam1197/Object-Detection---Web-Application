# Object-Detection---Web-Application
In This I've Detected Objects of the real world using images with the help of Keras and Deployed it on Web using Django 

In this I have Attempted to detect Objects of the real world using a pretrained model of Keras.
We have used the Pretrained Model as it will take less time to compute and analyse the data. 
ResNet50 is the pretrained model being used here,
Now from that we have provided the image we want to recognise and it gives the best Result possible for the particular image we have used.

Now in order to deploy it on Web we have used Django
Where we have create two pages :-
One For Uploading the Image 
Second for Seeing the result what our model has predicted of that image.
